My journey in this field started when I first played the game Age of Empires (Yes the first one) as a child. Soon I started playing more games and I took an interest in the possibilities of making modifications to games, things escalated from there and now I'm studying computer science and working as a developer for multiple companies and organisations.",

This year I had the amazing opportunity to do an exchange year at Widener University in the United States. During this year I'm learning more about databases, computer networks, and AI. I'm also part of a research project where I'm a computational expert. The project is researching a possible new way of curing cancer.",
        'p5' => "When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy horseback riding and volunteering for the Dutch police and Stichting SEIN. I believe that it is important to have a balanced life, and I make sure to carve out time, to help others and for the things that bring me joy and fulfillment. I am also a member of the elective board of the Widener Computer Science club, which allows me to network with others in my field and stay current on industry developments.",
